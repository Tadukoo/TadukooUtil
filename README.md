# TadukooUtil
Tadukoo Util is a collection of utilities for creating other interesting projects. They can be used in conjunction with 
[Tadukoo Engine/Launcher](https://tadukooverse.github.io/projects/TadukooEngine.html), or can be used separately in other 
programs if desired. This collection is not meant as a full smorgasbord of all libraries, but is just meant to include 
the most common libraries to be reused in most projects (e.g. common null-safe string/boolean checks, multimaps, 
throwing functional interfaces, etc.)
